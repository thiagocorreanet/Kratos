## Hello, everyone! Welcome to our Open Source project, WebAPI KRATOS. ü™ì


> [!WARNING]
> **What is the Kratos project?**
>
> A powerful API developed with .NET 8 and clean architecture, following the best industry practices to ensure quality, scalability, and maintainability.
>
> The initial idea is to assist developers with simple operations, such as creating CRUDs, which can be time-consuming in day-to-day work. The focus of this project is precisely to optimize time, allowing us to dedicate more attention to more complex logic ‚Äî something that Kratos cannot handle.

Regardless of the company or the industry, Kratos will always be ready to assist you in development with extremely high performance.
